# Jupyter Notebook: Analysis and Clustering

## Overview

This notebook performs data analysis and clustering using Python. It integrates data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning techniques.

### Key Features

- Data preprocessing using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.
- Clustering analysis using KMeans.
- Visualizations with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Evaluation metrics such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and distance calculations.

## Structure

- **Code cells**: 12
- **Markdown cells**: 6
- **Outputs generated**: 6
- **Key Libraries Used**:
  from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist, from sklearn.cluster import KMeans, from sklearn.metrics import adjusted_rand_score, from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances_argmin_min, from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, from sklearn.utils import resample, import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, import numpy as np, import pandas as pd, import seaborn as sns

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries if not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Untitled.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the markdown instructions and run the code cells sequentially.

## Highlights

- **Clustering Analysis**: Uses KMeans for clustering and evaluates performance using metrics like Adjusted Rand Index.
- **Visualization**: Generates clear and insightful plots for better understanding of data and clusters.
- **Extensibility**: Easily adaptable for different datasets or clustering techniques.

## Comments

The notebook contains detailed comments to guide users through the code. Additionally, markdown cells explain the theory and steps involved in the analysis.

## Outputs

The notebook produces visualizations and numerical results to illustrate clustering performance and data patterns.
